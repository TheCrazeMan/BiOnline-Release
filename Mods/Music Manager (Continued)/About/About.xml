Even so, if the original author requests it, or I see the original mod updates, I will remove this update.

I couldn't live without some music controls, immediately, in 1.5 ...
All props to Fluffy for this and their other mods. You're a legend.

Caveats:

1. The "Previous" button now just returns you to the start of the currently playing song. You can always pick a song directly from the menu. The "Next" button plays a random appropriate song. "Play/Pause" works as normal - EXCEPT if no song is playing, use "Next" in that instance (or it throws an error).

2. Any previous bugs/issues/functionality problems are untouched, and new ones have arisen! (See #1)

3. I may or may not do anything about improving this mod further, it seems to work for what I need it to do, and maybe you too. I make no promises. Anyway, source is included - improve it. I'd be only too happy to remove this mod if a better one arrives or if the original updates.

Original mod notes (1.4):
       
Manage your music. Like a boss.

Features:

Adds a music player widget to the game, with the usual audio control buttons; pause, play, next song, etc. The widget defaults to the top right of the screen, but can be unlocked in the mod settings, and then moved around at will.

Also included is a larger interface that lists all the songs available, and allows you to disable specific songs[not working?], change under which conditions songs are allowed to be played, and start playing any song in the database. Custom metadata is persisted across games. You can reset all metadata in the mods' settings screen.

You can control the default interval between songs by moving the appropriate sliders in the mods' settings screen.

Compatibility with other mods:

Music Manager is fully compatible with other mods that add music to the game.
